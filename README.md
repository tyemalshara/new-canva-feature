# new-canva-feature
This Repo demonstrates a better way than Canva to turn objects in image into a mockup-able, after witnessing a weird behavior (inconsistency of the image to be added to the mockup) when trying to change the background of a window by using the Click feature of Magic Edit in the Magic Studio.
