# new-canva-feature
This Repo demonstrates a better way than Canva to turn objects in image into a mockup-able, after witnessing a weird behavior (inconsistency of the image to be added to the mockup) when trying to change the background of a window by using the Click feature of Magic Edit in the Magic Studio.



## Features

- Turn any image to a mockup, and insert any image to the photo of your choice â€” wether on a window or a t-shirt.
- Drag and drop images (will be added to new releases when asked for)
- No need to browse endless catalog of customizable mockup templates and end up not finding one. create your very own template, cause your image can be turned onto a mockup template with one click of a button! (WebApp will be devoloped when asked for)
- inserted Images into mockups look magical and natural.
